        Nature refers to the interaction between the physical surroundings around us and the life within it like atmosphere, climate, natural resources, ecosystem, flora, fauna, and humans. Nature is indeed God’s precious gift to Earth. It is the primary source of all the basic necessities for the nourishment of all living beings on the Earth. Right from the food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the house we live in is provided by nature. Nature is called ‘Mother Nature’ because just like our mother, she is always nurturing us with all our needs. 
        Introduction
        The ecosystem of nature is a community in which producers (plants), consumers, and decomposers work together in their environment for survival. The natural fundamental processes like soil creation, photosynthesis, nutrient cycling, and water cycling, allows Earth to sustain life. We are dependent on these ecosystem services daily whether or not we are aware.

        Nature provides us services round the clock: provisional services, regulating services, and non-material services. Provisional services include benefits extracted from nature such as food, water, natural fuels and fibers, and medicinal plants. Regulating services include regulation of natural processes that include decomposition, water purification, pollution, erosion and flood control, and also, climate regulation.

        Non-material services are the non-material benefits that improve the cultural development of humans such as recreation, creative inspiration from interaction with nature like art, music, architecture, and the influence of ecosystems on local and global cultures. 

        The interaction between humans and animals, which are a part of nature alleviates stress, lessens pain and worries. Nature provides company and gives people a sense of purpose. 

        Studies and researches have shown that children especially have a natural affinity with nature. The regular interaction with nature has boosted health development in children. Nature supports their physical and mental health and instills abilities to access risks as they grow.
